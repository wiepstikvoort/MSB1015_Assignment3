# MSB1015_Assignment3
## Welcome!
Welcome to the repository of Assignment 3 for the course MSB1015 'Scientific Programming' 2019, taught at Maastricht University. The assignment was to use Nextflow, and compare the running times of the code between using different numbers of threads.

## Goal of the project
The goals was to gather information on the difference in running times of a piece of code, when the computing is parallelized or not parallelized. Parallelization means that multiple threads on your computer can work at the same time. In this case, multiple threads can work on different smiles and calculate the JPlogP values. Doing this one by one, on one thread, would logically increase the running time of the code. 

## Set up of methods


## How to run the code

## Results
This part will contain information and screenshots of the running times.

## Sources used for template code
Egon Willighagen and Martina Summer-Kutmon provided template code that were essential for the running of the code.
